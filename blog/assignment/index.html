                     <b>Niagara Falls</b>, Ontario, is a Canadian city at the famous waterfalls of 
                     the same name, linked with the U.S. by the <u>Rainbow Bridge</u>. Its site on 
                     the <em> River's western shore </em> the Horseshoe Falls, the cascades' 
                     most expansive section. Elevators take visitors to a lower, wetter vantage 
                     point behind the falls. A cliffside park features a promenade alongside 
                     520-ft.-high Skylon Tower with an observation deck.The features that became
                     Niagara Falls were created by the Wisconsin glaciation about 10,000 years ago. 
                     The retreat of the ice sheet left behind a large amount of meltwater (see Lake Algonquin, 
                     Lake Chicago, Glacial Lake Iroquois, and Champlain Sea) that filled up the basins
                     that the glaciers had carved, thus creating the Great Lakes as we know them today.
                     Scientists posit there is an old valley, St David's Buried Gorge, 
                     buried by glacial drift, at the approximate location of the present Welland Canal.</blockquote></p>
